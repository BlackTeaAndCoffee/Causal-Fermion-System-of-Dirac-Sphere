# Causal-Fermion-System-of-Dirac-Sphere
Basically for a set of parameters i use Symengine to produce a function, which is the integrand of the Action-Integral. The integration is done numerically. I am searching for the set of parameters, which minimizes the Integral.

[Causal-Fermion-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_fermion_system) are yet another approach to describe 
fundamental physics. 
This code is being developed for my Phd-Thesis. It is here for all who are interested in my work and 
maybe wan't to see how i did the calculations, use it for their own work or give me any useful hints.
This work is based on the Master Thesis of Nikki Kilbertus, of which you can download a copy on the wiki-page of this project.
